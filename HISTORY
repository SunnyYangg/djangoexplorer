0.5.0
=====

- Query logs! A very minimal implementation of logging previous queries. This is accessible via explorer/logs/. For now this just means you can look at previously executed queries (so you don't, for instance, lose that plauground query you were working on because you closed a browser tab). The data model is in place, and it's just a nice UI away from query versioning, reverts, and all sorts of other fancy things. For now it's for peace of mind and can be accessed at explorer/logs/
- Actually captures the creator of the query via a ForeignKey relation, instead of just using a Char field
- Re-introduced type information in the schema helpers
- Proper relative URL handling after downloading a query as CSV
- Users with view permissions can use query parameters. There is potential for SQL injection here. I think about the permissions as being about preventing users from borking up queries, not preventing them from viewing data. You've been warned.
- Refactored params handling for extra safety in multi-threaded enviros
