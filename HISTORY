0.5.0
=====

- Query logs! Accessible via explorer/logs/. You can look at previously executed queries (so you don't, for instance, lose that playground query you were working, or have to worry about mucking up a recorded query). It's quite usable now, and could be used for versioning and reverts in the future. Itan be accessed at explorer/logs/
- Actually captures the creator of the query via a ForeignKey relation, instead of just using a Char field.
- Re-introduced type information in the schema helpers.
- Proper relative URL handling after downloading a query as CSV.
- Users with view permissions can use query parameters. There is potential for SQL injection here. I think about the permissions as being about preventing users from borking up queries, not preventing them from viewing data. You've been warned.
- Refactored params handling for extra safety in multi-threaded environments.
